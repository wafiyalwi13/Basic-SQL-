// findings from queries that need to take action by asking what next to do

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. 
You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. 
Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.

SELECT *
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = 20180115 and type = 'murder' and city = 'SQL City'

//findings from report

SELECT *
FROM person

-- find Annabel in detail 
SELECT *
FROM person
ORDER BY name asc

Morty Schapiro - I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag.
The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags.
The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
Annabel Miller - I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer 
from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.
